# sars-cov-2-within-host-recombination

This repository contains code written for an eight-week internship project aiming to understand recombination in SARS-CoV-2 in a within-host context. It is not published or peer-reviewed. The project was supervised by Prof. Katrina Lythgoe and the idea for it was hers and Prof. Sally Otto's. This work roughly follows the methodology set out in McDonald et al (2016) and uses [SLiM](https://github.com/MesserLab/SLiM) for the simulation aspects.
